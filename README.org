* Medley Sound documentation project

This is an attempt to document Paul van der Valk's Medley Sound.

Medley Sound is the successor of Future Player and probably the most
known application it was used for was the background music of Imploder
V4.0.

In addition to plain documentation, some programs are supplied:

- tools/add_sample_header.py – an ugly hack to make raw unsigned 8-bit
  samples loadable into Medley Sound editor.

- tools/msodecode.py – a program to display Medley Sound Object flags
  and names of scores, tracks, instruments, and waves.

- tools/mso2pvms.py – a program to convert a Medley Sound Object
  (MSOB) back to the "PVMS" format readable by Medley Sound Editor
  (msed).

- tools/pvms2mso.py – a program to convert a "PVMS" file into an
  optimised Medley Sound Object.  This is currently work-in-progress.
