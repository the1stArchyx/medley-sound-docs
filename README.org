* Medley Sound documentation project

This is an attempt to document Paul van der Valk's Medley Sound.

Medley Sound is the successor of Future Player and probably the most
known application it was used for was the background music of Imploder
V4.0.

In addition to plain documentation, some programs are supplied:

- tools/msodecode.py – a program to display MSOB flags, scores,
  tracks, instruments, and waves.
- tools/mso2pvms.py – a program to convert a Medley Sound Object
  (MSOB) back to the "PVMS" format readable by Medley Sound Editor
  (msed).
